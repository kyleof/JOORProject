JOOR Testing

I used Eclipse/Java/TestNG/Selenium to achieve the Regression testing.

I created a Single Page Object which contained all the methods I needed to navigate from the homepage to logging out and everything inbetween.

Ideally I would have had time to split up the page objects correctly but for the sake of this task I kept them all to one page object.

Then I created a Test which contains 4 tests which use the Page Object I created.
